# NAME

Acme::Types::NonStandard - unbundled set of stupid types for Type::Tiny

# SYNOPSIS

    use Acme::Types::NonStandard -types;

# DESCRIPTION

### ConfusingDualVar

A dualvar (see ["dualvar" in Scalar::Util](https://metacpan.org/pod/Scalar::Util#dualvar)) whose stringy value must be a floating
point number or integer distinct from the numeric value (to maximize debugging
confusion).

### FortyTwo

The number 42. Always.

Can be coerced from Any (to the number 42).

### ReallySparseArray

An array that only contains `undef` (but as many of them as you'd like!)

### RefRefRef

A reference to a reference to a reference (to ensure adequate levels of
indirection).
